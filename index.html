          <strong>Dear ${name},</strong><br><br>
          This person wants to start by apologizing if they have ever been the reason your heart or your feelings (in the past few days) 
          were hurt. Those are things so incredibly precious to her, and the idea that she might have affected them negatively 
          is more hurtful to her herself than she can ever describe. 
          <br><br>
          Your heart is a treasure, your emotions are priceless, and everything you carry within you is something she holds so close to herself. 
          She wants you to know that your presence in her life keeps it happy, bright, and full of meaning.
          <br><br>
          She always tells you about how you bring light into her days, and just knowing youâ€™re there gives her the strength to face anything. 
          She would do anything to protect your heart and the preciousness that it contains, with her own bare hands, because you mean more 
          to her than words could ever capture.
          <br><br>
          Please never forget how cherished and deeply cared for you are. You are this person's safest space, her happiness, and concentrated 
          in you is so much that she holds dear. She is super grateful for you, and I hope you know how much you truly mean to her.
          <br><br>
          She also wants you to know that she misses you (and is a little jealous of the people who see you so often). But then, she finds solace 
          in memories and is happy to see you happy and wants to continue seeing you happy. She is always there. She will be there in the bad 
          days, in the good days. She will be there waiting to pull away any pain the world inflicts.
          <br><br>
          (Which is why she would NEVER want to be a reason the reader of this message feels down in any way). She will always be thereâ€”waiting. 
          This sounds like a simple sentence but she needs you to realize the depth and meaning this sentence contains. 
          <br><br>
          She will always be thereâ€”waiting. 
          <br><br>
          With all her heart,<br>
          Someone who cares deeply for you<br>
